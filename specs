i want a backend in my memetok project, it will be serverless.
my media apis are in streamlander, dont touch this, this is done now use the apis, people will upload there video.

1. use proper SOLID principals for coding
2. proper industry grade python fastapi setup, use mongo for db.
3. create services for backend.
4. clerk will be used for user auth.
5. post fetch will always be latest first, it will be done take and skip method
6. media service is stand alone, it will take the media, upload and return the id, save the only id and metadata.
7. url will be calculated on frontend
8. mongo and streamlander api will passed as env file
9. crate a core folder backend.
like this.

database/
    - mongo factory (singleton).py
    - mongo common.py

api/ index.py
core /
    - plugins
    - logger
    - services
    - resources/
        - posts/
            - service.py (service layer for posts) specific
            - handlers.py
            - dtos.py
            - validators.py
            - models.py
            - exceptions.py
            - contants.py
        - users/
        - comments/
        - likes/
config/
    - config.py
common
    - app constants.py
    - other things that are shared

as this project is serverless, there will cqrs setup, common api decide which event bus to call.
{
    type: "query",
    busName: "PostsQueryBus",
    payload: {
        query: "SELECT * FROM posts",
        params: {
            limit: 10,
            offset: 0
        }
    }
},
do it like this.
