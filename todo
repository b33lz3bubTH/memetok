need some optimization, dont pull likes and other things,
when the comment section is pulled, that time pull the data, create a local state, add the data there, so it doesnt fetch always.
use indexdb at frontend to cache this, create separte cqrs queries for it to work, else, its not a good thing.

save user name, and other things as well, so that i can show who uploaded that, save the profile photo.
and the current user who is logged in show his profile at the top of the page, floating, via clerk.
backend has to be just fetch post, no joining and other things, else the system will slow massively.
save post description with posts, while viewing the vide show only two lines of the posts description if not there dont show, when comments is open then only show the full description.
