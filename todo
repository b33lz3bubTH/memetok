1. the backend is awful, its not a single route setup.
2. there are handlers everywhere.
3. for get route its query, for post put and delete it will be mutation.

there will be one generic route that will take everything. create post is complex, so thats an exception, so keep it as it is.
in handlers, there will be

CQRS pattern.

from frontend it will be like {
    type: "query" | "mutation",
    action: "list_posts",
    payload: {
        take: 0,
        skip: 10
    }
}

this will be like this.
and handlers will be.

{
    action: posts.list_posts.value, //enums,
    handler: function to handle this.
}

this will be like this, best flow.

create proper enums and other things. and there will be a common event bus to exec things async. so that the main thread is never blocked.

i dont want duplicate codes, or useless codes, i need only generic endpoint that will be called by frontend to fetch data, except the create post, routes.
